###This readme gives a brief introduciton to the Majorana Algebra package.


For the time beeing there are only 4 types of majoranas bx,by,bz and c,
sice the package was developed with the Kitaev Honeycomb Model in mind.

The vacuums thus organised such that
by(j)|0> = i*bx(j)|0>
bz(j)|0> = i*c(j)|0>
And therse transforamtions are applied automatically.

The package supports Inner products though the constructions

IP = OpInnerProd(State1,State2)

IP = OpInnerProd(State1,Operator,State2)

The package also supports the use of MathLink syntax for algebraic prefactors.
THis allows for constructions like  W"a"*bx(1) or W`-I b`*by(1)
